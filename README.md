# HandyMan
A Widget for every need

Using different python libraries and frameworks, building widgets to serve the daily needs of a general pc user.
The aim is to learn and improve, while creating something exciting and useful.

The windows and UI for the whole program is built PyQt5.
Set of tools currently included -

1. Text editor
  First tool executed and helped to gain familiarity with PyQt.
 
2. Event Diary
  The reason behind this was to work with (sqlite3) databases in python and build a useful app too.
  Built on the Pyqt knowledge by working with QTableView, buttons, Calendar and Sqlite3 database Qt API.
  
  The Tables have two columns- for Date-Time and the other for Message to be stored. The entries are taken through 
  selection on Calendar and Spinboxes widgets.
